Studies show that being presented with an advert at an inconvenient time or place can lead to strong negative opinions of the brand.</br></br>UBlog allows you to share your brand in a covert way (See the benefits of covert advertising), Since the bloggers who request to advertise your brand are going to be interested in your company, theres a big chance that the majority of their followers are going to be interested too!! And tapping into this audience is made easy by the fact that many high profile bloggers have a die hard following who are just dying to see what they have been up to - and maybe to give it a go for themselves as well.</h6>
